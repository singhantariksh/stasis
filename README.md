## ✨ Features

Stasis doesn't just lock your screen after a timer—it understands context. Watching a video? Reading a document? Playing music? Stasis detects these scenarios and intelligently manages idle behavior, so you never have to jiggle your mouse to prevent an unwanted screen lock.

- **🧠 Smart idle detection** with configurable timeouts
- **🎵 Media-aware idle handling** – automatically detects media playback
- **🚫 Application-specific inhibitors** – prevent idle when specific apps are running
- **⏸️ Idle inhibitor respect** – honors Wayland idle inhibitor protocols
- **🛌 Lid events via DBus** – detect laptop lid open/close events to manage idle
- **⚙️ Flexible action system** – supports named action blocks and custom commands
- **🔍 Regex pattern matching** – powerful app filtering with regular expressions
- **📝 Clean configuration** – uses the intuitive [RUNE](https://github.com/saltnpepper97/rune-cfg) configuration language
- **⚡ Live reload** – update configuration without restarting the daemon

## 🗺️ Roadmap

> Stasis is evolving! Here’s what’s currently in progress, planned, and potential future features. Items are grouped to show what’s happening now and what’s coming next.

### Complete

- [x] **Sequential action blocks** – Action blocks run in the exact order defined in your config. Stasis maintains an internal index to track progress, making execution smarter and more reliable.  
- [x] **Lock-centric design** – When a `lock-screen` action block is present and properly configured, Stasis tracks the PID of the command it executes to ensure the sequence stays intact.  
- [x] **Resume-command support** – Each action block can run an optional follow-up command after completion.  
- [x] **Event-driven, minimal polling** – Stasis now relies primarily on two internal loops that notify others to wake from deep sleep, significantly reducing CPU and memory usage at idle.  
- [x] **CLI per-state triggers** – Trigger a **specific state**, the **current state**, or **all states**, all while respecting previously completed actions.  


### In Progress

- [ ] **User profiles / presets** – save and load different workflows for various scenarios (work, gaming, etc.).

### Planned

- [ ] **Custom notifications** – display alerts for idle events or action execution.
- [ ] **Logging & analytics** – historical idle data for power/performance insights.
- [ ] **Power-saving optimizations** – CPU/GPU-aware idle handling.


## 📦 Installation

### Arch Linux (AUR)

Install the stable release or latest development version:

```bash
# Stable release
yay -S stasis

# Or latest git version
yay -S stasis-git
```

Works with `paru` too:
```bash
paru -S stasis
```

### NixOS

**please note the note at the bottom about flakes and nix.**

If you use Nix flakes, `stasis` provides a `flake.nix` so you can build or
consume the package directly from flakes.

Quick ways to use `stasis` from flakes:

- Build directly from the remote flake (no local checkout required):

```bash
# build the stasis package from GitHub
nix build 'github:saltnpepper97/stasis#stasis'
```

- Add `stasis` as an input in your own `flake.nix` and reference the package in
  your outputs or NixOS configuration. Example (snippet):

```nix
inputs = {
  nixpkgs.url = "github:NixOS/nixpkgs/nixpkgs-unstable";
  stasis.url = "github:saltnpepper97/stasis";
};

outputs = { self, nixpkgs, ... }:
let
  system = "x86_64-linux"; # adjust for your host
in {
  # reference the stasis package from the stasis flake
  packages.${system}.my-stasis = self.inputs.stasis.packages.${system}.stasis;

  # Or add it to a NixOS configuration
  nixosConfigurations.<host> = nixpkgs.lib.nixosSystem {
    inherit system;
    modules = [ ./configuration.nix ];
    configuration = {
      environment.systemPackages = [ self.inputs.stasis.packages.${system}.stasis ];
    };
  };
}
```

Notes:
- please know this i am a complete noob in nix and flakes, so updates and fixes will be appreciated! --CamRed25

### From Source

Build and install manually for maximum control:

```bash
# Clone and build
git clone https://github.com/saltnpepper97/stasis
cd stasis
cargo build --release --locked

# Install system-wide
sudo install -Dm755 target/release/stasis /usr/local/bin/stasis

# Or install to user directory
install -Dm755 target/release/stasis ~/.local/bin/stasis
```

## 🚀 Quick Start

Get up and running in just a few minutes!  
See the [webpage](https://saltnpepper97.github.io/stasis/) for quick start instructions, including how to ensure your user is in the `input` group and much more!

## Compositor Support

Stasis integrates with each compositor's native IPC protocol for optimal app detection and inhibition.

| Compositor | Support Status | Notes |
|------------|---------------|-------|
| **Niri** | ✅ Full Support | Tested and working perfectly |
| **Hyprland** | ✅ Full Support | Native IPC integration |
| **labwc** | ⚠️ Limited | Process-based fallback (details below) |
| **River** | ⚠️ Limited | Process-based fallback (details below) |
| **Your Favorite** | 🤝 PRs Welcome | Help us expand support! |

### 📌 River & labwc Compatibility Notes

Both River and labwc have IPC protocol limitations that affect Stasis functionality:

- **Limited window enumeration:** These compositors don't provide complete window lists via IPC
- **Fallback mode:** Stasis uses process-based detection (sysinfo) for app inhibition
- **Pattern adjustments:** Executable names may differ from app IDs—check logs and adjust regex patterns accordingly

> **💡 Tip:** When using River or labwc, include both exact executable names and flexible regex patterns in your `inhibit_apps` configuration. Enable verbose logging to see which apps are detected.

### Want to Add Compositor Support?

We welcome contributions! Adding support typically involves:

1. Implementing the compositor's native IPC protocol
2. Adding window/app detection functionality  
3. Testing with common applications

Check existing implementations in the codebase for reference, and don't hesitate to open an issue if you need guidance.

## 🔧 About RUNE Configuration

Stasis uses **[RUNE](https://github.com/saltnpepper97/rune-cfg)**—a purpose-built configuration language that's both powerful and approachable.

**Why RUNE?**
- 📖 **Human-readable:** Clean syntax that makes sense at a glance
- 🔢 **Variables:** Define once, reference anywhere
- 🎯 **Type-safe:** Catch configuration errors before runtime
- 📦 **Nested blocks:** Organize complex configurations naturally
- 🔤 **Raw strings:** Use `r"regex.*"` for patterns without escaping hell
- 💬 **Comments:** Document your config with `#`
- 🏷️ **Metadata:** Add context with `@` annotations

RUNE makes configuration feel less like programming and more like describing what you want—because that's what a config should be.
